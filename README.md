<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
This PCB was created as a workshop aid to teach people about LEDs and soldering.  The PCB is intended to be worn on a lanyard, as a way to keep us all glowing at night.

### Created With

* [Procreate](https://procreate.art/)
* [Affinity Designer](https://affinity.serif.com/)
* [Kicad 6.0](https://kicad.org/)
* [OshPark](https://oshpark.com/)


<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Welcome

This PCB was created to teach people how to solder, and to be passed out as gifts at SOAK 2022 in Oregon.  
The designs are free to be redesigned however you'd like.  

### Build it! 

Components are easy to source and assemble!  
Uses a generic AAA single battery holder x2, your favorite 5mm LED!  (we like these colorchanging ones), and this
tiny switch to conserve your battery power
