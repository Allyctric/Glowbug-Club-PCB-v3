<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Welcome

This PCB was created to teach people how to solder, and to be passed out as gifts at SOAK 2022 in Oregon.  
The designs are free to be redesigned however you'd like.  

### Build it! 

Components are easy to source and assemble!  
Uses a [generic AAA single battery holder x2](https://www.mouser.com/ProductDetail/12BH412-GR), your favorite 5mm LED!  (we like these [colorchanging ones](https://www.amazon.com/Multicolor-Flashing-Changing-Electronics-Components/dp/B01C19END2/ref=sr_1_13?crid=3ENC4HC6ILEX9&keywords=slow+flash+led+5mm&qid=1654971525&sprefix=slow+flash+led+5mm%2Caps%2C144&sr=8-13)), and this
